docgenerator
======

`docgenerator` is a web application that dynamically presents system requirements documentation directly from issue trackers and wikis. 

Currently, `docgenerator` only supports Fog Creek's [FogBugz](http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/). Plans are in place to support Atlassian's [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence).

Point `docgenerator` at your instance of FogBugz, and it will pull specified requirements, and wiki entries to generate a requirements document artifact.

## Configuration

Edit lines 4-5 with the URL and Token needed to access the FogBugz API.

## Getting Started

    vagrant up

This will initialize a vagrant box and start a docker container running the flask app.

## Dependencies

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Python FogBugz API Wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fogbugz/)
 
## Commercial Adaptation

The concepts used in `docgenerator` have been implemented in the commercial tool: [Da√ºxer](http://www.dauxer.de).
